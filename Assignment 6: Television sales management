/*Create a C++ class named Television that has data members to hold the model number and the screen size in inches, and the price.
Member functions include overloaded insertion and extraction operators. If more than four digits are entered for the model, 
if the screen size is smaller than 12 or greater than 70 inches, or if the price is negative or over $5000 then throw an integer. 
Write a main() function that instantiates a television object, allows user to enter data and displays the data members .
If an exception is caught, replace all the data member values with zero values.*/
